The DWARFLabs DWARF mini telescope stores the raw FITS files differently than is needed by the Siril image post-processing application.

This is a simple script to copy/move the files to the correct folders. It also does a little validation of the calibration files to limit the copy to only relevant files.

The script was written with a tremendous amount of help from Google Gemini AI, but every line has been reviewed and tested by me.
